# Touch Support for Keyboard Component

## Overview

The Keyboard component has been enhanced with comprehensive touch support for mobile devices. All interactive elements now respond to touch events in addition to mouse events.

## Features Added

### 1. Touch Event Handlers
- **Touch Start**: Triggers when a finger touches the screen
- **Touch End**: Triggers when a finger is lifted from the screen
- **Touch Cancel**: Triggers when a touch is interrupted (e.g., by scrolling)

### 2. Components Updated

#### MelodyKeys
- Individual key buttons now respond to touch events
- Maintains visual feedback for pressed state
- Prevents default touch behavior to avoid conflicts

#### ChordKeys
- Triad buttons support touch interaction
- Root note buttons support touch interaction
- Chord modifier buttons support touch interaction
- All buttons maintain proper visual feedback

#### AdvancedKeys
- White keys support touch interaction
- Black keys support touch interaction
- Proper z-index layering maintained for touch

#### Main Keyboard Controls
- Mode selection buttons (Simple/Basic, Notes/Chord)
- Octave control buttons
- Chord voicing control buttons
- Sustain control buttons
- Settings button

### 3. CSS Enhancements

#### Touch-Friendly Styling
- `touch-action: manipulation` prevents unwanted zooming
- `user-select: none` prevents text selection
- `-webkit-touch-callout: none` prevents callouts on iOS

#### Responsive Touch Feedback
- Scale transform on active state for better feedback
- Optimized for devices without hover capability

## Technical Implementation

### Touch Event Hook
Created `useTouchEvents` hook in `src/hooks/useTouchEvents.ts` that provides:
- `onTouchStart` handler
- `onTouchEnd` handler  
- `onTouchCancel` handler
- Automatic `preventDefault()` calls to avoid conflicts

### Event Prevention
All touch events call `preventDefault()` to:
- Prevent double-triggering with mouse events
- Avoid unwanted browser behaviors
- Ensure consistent behavior across devices

### CSS Classes
- `touch-manipulation` class applied to all interactive elements
- Responsive media queries for touch-specific styling
- Optimized for both touch and mouse interactions

## Browser Support

- **iOS Safari**: Full support
- **Android Chrome**: Full support
- **Desktop browsers**: Maintains existing mouse support
- **Hybrid devices**: Supports both touch and mouse

## Usage

The touch support is automatically enabled for all keyboard components. No additional configuration is required. Users can:

1. **Tap keys** to play notes
2. **Hold keys** for sustained notes
3. **Use control buttons** for octave, mode, and sustain changes
4. **Interact with chord modifiers** in chord mode

## Performance Considerations

- Touch events are optimized to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Event handlers are memoized using `useCallback`
- CSS transforms are used for visual feedback instead of layout changes
- Touch events are prevented from bubbling to avoid conflicts

## Testing

To test touch support:
1. Open the application on a mobile device or use browser dev tools
2. Enable touch simulation in browser dev tools
3. Test all interactive elements:
   - Key presses in all modes
   - Control button interactions
   - Sustain functionality
   - Chord modifier interactions
